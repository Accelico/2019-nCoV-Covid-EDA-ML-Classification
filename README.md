# 2019-nCoV-Covid-EDA-ML-Classification
Kaggle kernel and python notebook on exploratory data analysis and machine learning classification of confirmed cases. 
Used numpy, pandas, and missingno to conduct EDA on the Covid dataset (https://bit.ly/39pawca). Preprocessed categorical, 
numerical data and packaged it into a pipeline. Pipeline included building a supervised RandomForestRegressor machine learning model 
to predict confirmed cases based on features such as 'Country', 'Province/State', 'Deaths', and 'Recovered'. Evaluated model using cross
validation, and a mean absolute error metric.
